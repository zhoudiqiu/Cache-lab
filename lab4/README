This is the handout directory for the CS:APP Cache Lab. 

************************
Running the autograders:
************************

Before running the autograders, compile your code:
    linux> make

Check the correctness of your simulator:
    linux> ./test-csim

******
Files:
******

The only file that the autograder will collect is the csim.c file,
so implement your cache simulator in that file only.

# Tools for evaluating your simulator
Makefile     Builds the simulator
README       This file
cachelab.c   Required helper functions
cachelab.h   Required header file
csim-ref*    The executable reference cache simulator
test-csim*   Tests your cache simulator
traces/      Trace files used by test-csim.c
